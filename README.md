## What is OSINTprofiles?
OSINTprofiles is responsible for hosting the information for scraping news
sites in a generic and standardized way, to enable OSINTbackend to function as
a generic scraping engine for these sites, and thereby managing the wast
differences in modern websites in a manageable way that doesn't involve to much
boilerplate code.
